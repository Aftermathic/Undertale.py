# Undertale.py
A Undertale engine using Python, and other libraries.

I got the idea from [Create Your Frisk](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk), it was made by RhenaudTheLukark. Check it out, it's way better.

If you want, you can fork this project and make it better, because my code can be messy.
